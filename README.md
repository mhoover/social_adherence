# Social Adherence to ART in Uganda
The Social Adherence to ART in Uganda analyses are associated with NIH-funded (1R21MH087249-01A1) project 'Social Network Dynamics and HIV Care, Retention, and Adherence in Uganda,' work led by [Gery Ryan](http://www.rand.org/about/people/r/ryan_gery.html) and [Hank Green](http://www.rand.org/about/people/g/green_hank.html) of the [RAND Corporation](http://www.rand.org). The nature of this repository is to keep a public, reproducible record of the work done in undertaking analyses in preparation of publication.

Data is not currently available to the public, but will (hopefully) be made available once the paper(s) for the project are in press.
